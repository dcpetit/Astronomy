# Astronomy/Astrophysics

## Research at, and after, KU Leuven

I worked on a master's thesis at KU Leuven in Belgium for some time. Much of the code I have been writing is saved here. I am collaborating with my former supervisor to turn the work done in my thesis into a published paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

Simultaneously, I am applying to PhD positions around the world, and would be happy to collaborate with anyone on research regarding exoplanets, especially characterizations, modeling, observations, and astronomical hardware and software instrumentation.

Feel free to reach out, though I am only fluent in English, I am happy to communicate in: Español, 中文, Nederlands, 日本語, Français, 한국어, and عربي with you. Thank you for your interest!
