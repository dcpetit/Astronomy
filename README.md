## My master's thesis (project) at KU Leuven##

I have been working on a master's thesis at KU Leuven in Belgium for some time.
Much of the code I have been writing is saved here. I am applying to PhD positions around the world,
and would be happy to collaborate with anyone on research regarding exoplanets, especially characterizations, modeling, observations, and instrumentation. 

Feel free to reach out, though I am only fluent in English, I am happy to commnuicate in Espanol, Mandarin, Nederlands, Japanese, Francais, Korean, or Arabic with you. Thank you for your interest
