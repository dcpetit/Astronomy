## Research at (and after) UniSQ and KU Leuven

I worked on a master's thesis at KU Leuven in Belgium for some time. Much of the code I have been writing is saved here. I am continuing the research I started there at UniSQ in Australia along with other astrophysical projects. I aim to expand my thesis into a published paper in a peer-reviewed journal.

Simultaneously, I am working on optical design and CubeSats for the democratization of space-based observational astronomy, and would be happy to collaborate with anyone on research regarding exoplanets, especially characterizations, modeling, observations, and astronomical hardware and software instrumentation.
